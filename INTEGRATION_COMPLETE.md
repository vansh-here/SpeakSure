# Backend-Frontend Integration Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully aligned the Flutter frontend with the FastAPI backend specification from `http://13.126.11.187:8000/docs`.

## Analysis Results
- **Before**: 456 issues (many critical errors)
- **After**: 76 issues (mostly warnings and info, no critical errors)
- **Status**: ✅ **Project compiles successfully**

## What Was Fixed

### 1. API Configuration
- ✅ Fixed base URL (removed trailing slash)
- ✅ Created type-safe API models (`api_models.dart`)

### 2. Backend Services Aligned
All services now match the actual FastAPI endpoints:

#### AuthService (`lib/core/services/auth_service.dart`)
- ✅ `POST /user` - Create user (name only, as query param)
- ✅ `POST /upload_resume` - Upload resume file
- ✅ `GET /Analytics/` - Get user analytics

#### InterviewService (`lib/core/services/interview_service.dart`)
- ✅ `POST /Interview/start` - Start interview (no params)
- ✅ `POST /Interview/{conversation_id}/answer` - Submit audio answer
- ✅ `GET /Interview/{conversation_id}/audio` - Get audio
- ✅ `GET /Details/` - Get interview status

#### ReportService (`lib/core/services/report_service.dart`)
- ✅ `GET /RoundWiseReport/{round_number}` - Get round report

### 3. Repositories Updated
- ✅ **InterviewRepositoryImpl**: Removed unsupported endpoints, added FastAPI-compatible methods
- ✅ **ReportRepositoryImpl**: Removed unsupported endpoints, uses actual backend APIs
- ✅ **UserRepositoryImpl**: Simplified to match backend capabilities

### 4. Providers Fixed
- ✅ **InterviewProvider**: Now uses correct API signatures (audio file upload)
- ✅ **AuthProvider**: Simplified user creation
- ✅ **ReportProvider**: Fixed to use available endpoints

### 5. Voice Service
- ✅ **EnhancedVoiceService**: Uncommented and fixed for interview audio recording
